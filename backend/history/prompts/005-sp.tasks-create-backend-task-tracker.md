# Phase II Backend Task Tracker Creation

## Summary
Created the Phase II Backend Task Tracker document for the Hackathon II Todo App, defining the tasks needed for backend implementation according to the plan and specification, with placeholders for completion status.

## Prompt Text
```
create "Phase II Backend Task Tracker with PHR"

Description:
Create a detailed task tracker for Phase II backend implementation of Hackathon II Todo Full-Stack Web Application.
Each task should correspond to a step in the sp.plan and include placeholders for completion status.
Automatically create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this command.

Requirements:
1. Write the tasks inside:
   - fullstackwebapp/backend/sp.tasks

2. Sections to include:

## Overview
- Purpose: Track all backend implementation steps
- Align tasks with sp.plan and sp.specify
- Include beginner-friendly task descriptions

## Task List

1. **Project structure setup**
   - Create placeholders for:
     - main.py
     - routes/ directory
     - models.py
     - db.py
     - history/ (for prompts)
   - Status: Pending

2. **Database connection setup**
   - Configure Neon PostgreSQL connection
   - Ensure SQLModel usage
   - Status: Pending

3. **Authentication & JWT middleware**
   - Implement middleware placeholder
   - Verify JWT and decode user identity
   - Status: Pending

4. **Task CRUD endpoints placeholders**
   - GET /api/tasks
   - POST /api/tasks
   - GET /api/tasks/{id}
   - PUT /api/tasks/{id}
   - DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
   - PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete
   - Status: Pending

5. **Data validation & integrity**
   - Input validation rules
   - Ownership enforcement
   - Error handling (401, 403, 404, 400)
   - Status: Pending

6. **Testing & iteration**
   - Unit test placeholders
   - Integration test plan
   - Ensure user task isolation
   - Status: Pending

## Dependencies & Reusable Components
- Reference reusable agents and skills from .claude folder
- Use Todo Domain Skill for task rules
- Use Hackathon Guard agent for security checks

## Constraints
- No frontend code
- No implementation yet
- Keep tasks beginner-friendly and actionable

## Prompt History Recording (PHR)
- Automatically create PHR entry for this command
- Save location: fullstackwebapp/backend/history/prompts/
- Include:
  - Command used
  - Intent description
  - Full original prompt text
  - Note about automatic recording per backend constitution

Instructions for Claude:
- Generate the task list only
- Include placeholders and status for each task
- Do not implement any code yet
- Confirm completion
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created the Phase II Backend Task Tracker document at `fullstackwebapp/backend/sp.tasks` with all required sections. The tracker includes an overview, detailed task list with six main tasks (project structure, database connection, authentication, CRUD endpoints, data validation, and testing), dependencies, constraints, and prompt history recording requirements. Each task includes a status indicator set to "Pending" as requested.
