# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.7 – Testing & Integration Guidance Placeholder

## Intent
Add placeholders and guidance for testing and integration in the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend without implementing actual test code or database integration.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.7 – Testing & Integration Guidance Placeholder"

Description:
Add placeholders and guidance for testing and integration in the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend. No actual test code or database integration should be written yet.

Requirements:
1. Provide guidance for unit testing each endpoint:
   - GET /api/tasks
   - POST /api/tasks
   - GET /api/tasks/{id}
   - PUT /api/tasks/{id}
   - DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
   - PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete
   - Include comments on what to test for: input validation, ownership enforcement, error responses, and completion toggling
2. Provide guidance for integration testing:
   - Explain how endpoints should interact with the database (placeholder guidance only)
   - Suggest verifying data integrity, user isolation, and response correctness
3. Maintain beginner-friendly comments and docstrings
4. Keep formatting consistent with previous steps
5. Create a Prompt History Record (PHR) documenting this step in backend/history/prompts/:
   - Include command used
   - Intent description
   - Full original prompt text
   - Note about automatic recording per backend constitution

Instructions for Claude:
- Only write placeholders and comments; do not implement actual tests or database calls
- Keep the code simple, clean, and beginner-friendly
- Clearly indicate where test logic and integration guidance should be implemented

## Response Summary
Successfully added comprehensive testing and integration guidance to the routes/tasks.py file. The implementation includes:

- Added unit testing guidance for all six endpoints (GET, POST, GET by ID, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Included specific test scenarios for input validation, ownership enforcement, error responses, and completion toggling
- Added integration testing guidance covering database interaction, data integrity, user isolation, and response correctness
- Maintained beginner-friendly language and consistent formatting with previous steps
- Placed all guidance in the documentation section at the top of the file for easy reference

## Execution Note
The routes/tasks.py file has been enhanced with comprehensive testing and integration guidance as required, providing clear direction for future test implementation without writing actual test code or database integration.
