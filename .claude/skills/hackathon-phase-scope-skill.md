# Hackathon Phase Scope Skill

This skill encapsulates Hackathon II phase rules and scope boundaries, ensuring compliance with phase-specific requirements and preventing scope creep.

## Phase II Scope Definition

### In Scope for Phase II
- Core application functionality implementation
- Basic user interface and user experience
- Core domain logic and business rules
- Essential data models and relationships
- Basic authentication and user management
- Core API endpoints and data flow
- Fundamental testing and quality assurance
- Basic deployment configuration
- Core documentation and user guides
- Specification-driven development workflow
- Agent and skill implementation
- Basic CI/CD pipeline setup

### Out of Scope for Phase II (Defer to Later Phases)
- Advanced performance optimization
- Complex third-party integrations
- Advanced security features beyond basic auth
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-language support
- Advanced accessibility features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Complex microservices architecture
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Advanced DevOps automation
- Advanced AI/ML features
- Advanced mobile responsiveness beyond basic
- Advanced payment processing
- Advanced notification systems
- Advanced admin panels
- Cloud-native advanced features
- Advanced chatbot capabilities
- Advanced cloud deployment strategies

## Scope Boundary Detection

### Scope Creep Indicators
- Adding features not defined in original specifications
- Implementing advanced functionality without approval
- Adding unnecessary third-party integrations
- Expanding user roles or permissions beyond basic requirements
- Adding complex business logic not in original scope
- Implementing advanced UI animations or effects
- Adding non-essential API endpoints
- Expanding database schema beyond core requirements
- Adding complex testing scenarios not in original plan
- Implementing advanced deployment strategies prematurely

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regular validation against original phase requirements
- Continuous checking for feature creep during development
- Verification that all work aligns with Phase II objectives
- Monitoring for unauthorized expansion of scope
- Review of all deliverables against phase requirements

## Phase-Specific Deliverables

### Required Phase II Deliverables
- Functional application with core features
- Basic user interface meeting requirements
- Complete domain model implementation
- Working API endpoints for core functionality
- Basic authentication system
- Core data persistence layer
- Essential unit and integration tests
- Basic deployment configuration
- Core documentation (API, user guides)
- Specification documents
- Implementation artifacts
- Basic CI/CD pipeline
- Agent implementations
- Skill definitions

### Deliverable Validation Criteria
- All deliverables must align with approved specifications
- Core functionality must be fully implemented
- Basic UI must be functional and navigable
- All essential tests must pass
- Deployment must be successful
- Documentation must be complete and accurate
- All agents and skills must be properly implemented

## Disqualification Risk Prevention

### Risk Factors
- Implementing features outside Phase II scope
- Missing required deliverables
- Failing to follow specification-driven development
- Deviating from approved architecture
- Non-compliance with technical requirements
- Missing submission deadlines
- Incomplete testing or documentation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Regular scope validation checks
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Early detection of scope creep
- Proper phase boundary enforcement
- Clear communication of limitations
- Focus on quality over quantity within scope

## Phase Transition Guidelines

### Phase II Completion Criteria
- All in-scope features are implemented and tested
- All required deliverables are complete
- No scope creep has occurred
- All specifications are properly implemented
- Basic functionality is working end-to-end
- Documentation is complete
- Code quality meets standards

### Transition Preparation
- Verify all Phase II requirements are met
- Document any Phase II-specific decisions
- Prepare handoff materials for future phases
- Identify features that must be deferred
- Create clear boundaries for future phases

## Validation Checklist

Before approving any work for Phase II, verify:

- [ ] Work aligns with Phase II scope definition
- [ ] Feature is within approved scope boundaries
- [ ] No scope creep is present
- [ ] Work supports required deliverables
- [ ] Implementation follows specification
- [ ] No advanced features beyond Phase II scope
- [ ] Timeline is realistic for Phase II
- [ ] Resources are appropriate for Phase II

## Enforcement Actions

When scope violations are detected:

1. **Immediate Identification**: Flag the scope violation immediately
2. **Scope Assessment**: Determine if the feature is in or out of Phase II scope
3. **Deferral Decision**: Mark out-of-scope items for later phases
4. **Realignment**: Redirect efforts back to Phase II appropriate work
5. **Documentation**: Record the scope decision for future reference
6. **Communication**: Inform team of scope boundaries and decisions

## Integration with Evaluation Criteria

This skill ensures alignment with evaluation criteria by:
- Focusing efforts on evaluable Phase II requirements
- Preventing work on non-evaluable advanced features
- Ensuring deliverables match evaluation expectations
- Maintaining focus on core functionality over bells and whistles
- Prioritizing specification compliance over feature expansion
