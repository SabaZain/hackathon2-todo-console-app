# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.2 – Task Endpoint Placeholders

## Intent
Expand the task router skeleton (routes/tasks.py) for the Phase II Hackathon II Todo App backend with detailed placeholders for each endpoint.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.2 – Task Endpoint Placeholders"

Description:
I want you to expand the task router skeleton (routes/tasks.py) for the Phase II Hackathon II Todo App backend. Create detailed placeholders for each endpoint with beginner-friendly guidance and proper comments, but do not implement actual database queries yet.

Requirements:
1. For each endpoint (GET /api/tasks, POST /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks/{id}, PUT /api/tasks/{id}, DELETE /api/tasks/{id}, PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete):
   - Include detailed placeholder code with clear comments about:
     - What input parameters are expected
     - Expected response structure (fields and types)
     - Status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404)
     - Ownership rules (users can only access their own tasks)
     - Input validation notes (required vs optional fields, length limits, formats)
     - Any additional business rules (completion toggling, filtering)
2. Keep all code beginner-friendly and fully commented for future implementation.
3. Maintain clean, consistent formatting in routes/tasks.py.
4. Do not add actual database logic or SQLModel queries yet.
5. Include docstrings explaining the purpose of each endpoint.
6. Create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this step, saved in backend/history/prompts/, documenting:
   - The command used
   - Intent description
   - Full original prompt text
   - Note that this follows the backend constitution Prompt History Recording Rule

Instructions for Claude:
- Only write placeholder code with detailed guidance in comments and docstrings.
- Preserve all existing imports and router instance from Step 5.1.
- Make it easy for a beginner to later fill in actual implementation.
- Ensure each placeholder clearly indicates where the actual logic should go.

## Response Summary
Successfully expanded the task router with detailed placeholders for each endpoint in routes/tasks.py. The implementation includes:
- Enhanced docstrings with detailed information about input parameters, response structures, and status codes
- Comprehensive comments detailing ownership rules, input validation requirements, and business rules
- Clear TODO comments indicating where actual database logic should be implemented
- Proper error handling guidance with HTTPException usage
- Consistent formatting and beginner-friendly structure throughout

## Execution Note
The task router has been expanded with detailed placeholders as required, maintaining all existing functionality while adding comprehensive guidance for future implementation of actual database logic.
