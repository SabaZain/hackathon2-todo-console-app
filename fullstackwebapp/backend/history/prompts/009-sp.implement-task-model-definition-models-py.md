# Prompt History Record: Task Model Definition (models.py)

## Intent
Implement the database models for the Phase II backend, specifically the Task model representing a todo item.

## Original Prompt
implement "Task Model Definition (models.py)"

Description:
Implement the database models for the Phase II backend.

Context:
- Project: Hackathon II Todo App
- Backend stack: FastAPI + SQLModel
- Database connection already implemented in db.py
- This step defines only data structure
- Must follow sp.implement rules

Requirements:
1. Modify only: fullstackwebapp/backend/models.py
2. Use SQLModel to define database models
3. Create a Task model representing a todo item
4. Include fields:
   - id (primary key)
   - title (string, required)
   - description (string, optional)
   - completed (boolean, default false)
   - owner_id (integer, required)
   - created_at (datetime)
5. Use appropriate defaults and typing
6. Keep code simple and beginner-friendly
7. Add comments explaining each field
8. Do not implement relationships yet
9. Do not create tables or database sessions

Out of Scope:
- Routes
- Authentication
- Database execution logic

Prompt History Recording (PHR):
- Automatically create a Prompt History Record
- Save under: fullstackwebapp/backend/history/prompts/
- Include command, intent, full prompt, and execution note

Instructions:
- Implement only models.py
- Do not touch any other files
- Confirm once completed

## Response Summary
Successfully implemented the Task model in models.py. The implementation includes:
- Proper imports for SQLModel, datetime, and typing
- A Task class that inherits from SQLModel with table=True
- All required fields: id, title, description, completed, owner_id, and created_at
- Appropriate defaults and typing for each field
- Detailed comments explaining each field and its purpose
- Clean, simple, and beginner-friendly code structure

## Execution Note
The Task model has been implemented following all requirements, including proper SQLModel usage, appropriate field types, and comprehensive documentation.
