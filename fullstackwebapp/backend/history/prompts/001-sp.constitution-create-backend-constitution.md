## Command
/sp.constitution create "Phase II Backend Constitution"

## Description
Initial creation of the backend constitution defining rules and boundaries for the backend of the Phase II Hackathon II Todo App.

## Original Prompt Text
```
create "Phase II Backend Constitution"

Description:
Define the constitutional rules and boundaries for the backend of the Phase II Hackathon II Todo App.
This constitution will guide all future backend planning and implementation.

Requirements:
1. Write the constitution inside:
   - fullstackwebapp/backend/sp.constitution

2. The constitution must clearly define:
   - Backend responsibilities
   - Backend non-responsibilities
   - Architectural boundaries
   - Security and data ownership rules
   - Spec-driven development rules
   - Usage of reusable agents and skills

3. Include the following sections:

## Backend Purpose
Explain the role of the backend in Phase II (API, authentication verification, data persistence).

## Scope of Responsibility
Clearly list what the backend IS responsible for.

## Out of Scope
Clearly list what the backend must NOT do (frontend UI logic, frontend routing, auth UI, styling, etc).

## Authentication & Security Rules
- JWT-based authentication verification
- User identity must be derived from JWT token
- User isolation must be enforced at all times
- Requests without valid tokens must be rejected

## Data Rules
- Tasks always belong to exactly one authenticated user
- Backend must never return or modify tasks of another user
- All validation and ownership checks happen in backend
- Backend is the source of truth for task state

## Reusable Agents & Skills
- Global agents and skills may exist in the root `.claude/agents` and `.claude/skills` folders
- Backend work may reuse these agents and skills when relevant and appropriate
- Reusable agents must respect backend scope boundaries
- Backend-specific decisions must not be overridden by frontend-focused agents
- Agents should be used as guidance, not as authority over specs

## Spec-Driven Rules
- Backend implementation must always follow written specs
- No implementation without a corresponding spec
- Specs are the source of truth, not assumptions
- If a spec is unclear, it must be refined before implementation

## Collaboration Rules
- Backend consumes API contracts defined in specs
- Backend does not assume frontend behavior
- Backend exposes stable APIs but does not control UI
- Backend agents must respect skill and domain boundaries

4. Writing Style:
- Clear
- Simple
- Beginner-friendly
- Declarative (rules, not code)

5. Constraints:
- Do NOT write any code
- Do NOT mention specific libraries beyond high-level names
- Do NOT create endpoints
- Do NOT create schemas

6. After writing, confirm completion only.

Instructions for Claude:
- This file acts as a permanent backend guardrail
- Be strict but understandable
