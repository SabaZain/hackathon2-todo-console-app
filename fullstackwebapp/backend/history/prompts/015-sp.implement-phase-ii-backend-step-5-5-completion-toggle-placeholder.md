# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.5 – Completion Toggle Placeholder

## Intent
Expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend to include placeholders for toggling task completion.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.5 – Completion Toggle Placeholder"

Description:
Expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend to include placeholders for toggling task completion. No database queries should be implemented yet.

Requirements:
1. For the PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete endpoint:
   - Add comments and placeholder code for toggling the task's 'completed' status
   - Include placeholder guidance for:
     - Fetching the task by ID
     - Checking ownership/user isolation
     - Changing the completed field from True to False or False to True
     - Returning appropriate status messages
   - Include beginner-friendly comments to indicate where actual logic should be implemented
   - Maintain consistent formatting and placeholder style with previous steps
2. Ensure the endpoint docstring explains the purpose of the completion toggle
3. Create a Prompt History Record (PHR) documenting this step in backend/history/prompts/:
   - Include command used
   - Intent description
   - Full original prompt text
   - Note about automatic recording per backend constitution

Instructions for Claude:
- Only write placeholders and comments; do not implement actual database logic
- Keep code simple, clean, and beginner-friendly
- Clearly indicate where completion toggle logic should occur

## Response Summary
Successfully enhanced the PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete endpoint in routes/tasks.py with comprehensive completion toggle placeholders. The implementation includes:
- Added detailed comments explaining the completion toggle logic with 5-step process
- Enhanced with specific guidance for fetching the task by ID
- Added ownership/user isolation verification comments
- Included instructions for toggling completion status (True/False)
- Added guidance for returning appropriate status messages
- Maintained consistent formatting and placeholder style with previous steps
- Added beginner-friendly comments indicating where actual logic should be implemented

## Execution Note
The completion toggle endpoint has been enhanced with comprehensive placeholders as required, providing clear guidance for future implementation of the actual completion toggle logic.
