# Prompt Text
```
/sp.improve Project Context:
- Root folder: hackathontwo
- Phase 4 folder: hackathontwo/phase4-local-k8s
- Application: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot (frontend + backend)
- Phase 1-3 complete; Phase 4 focuses on local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, Docker, and optional Helm charts
- All reusable agents and skills are defined in hackathontwo/.claude/

Goals:
- Enhance the existing Phase 4 implementation with optional improvements
- Focus on:
  1. **History Folder Enhancements**: Include previous builds, logs, validation reports
  2. **Future CI/CD Integration**: Provide guidelines or sample GitHub Actions workflow for automated Phase 4 deployments
  3. **Extra Beginner Tips**: Add inline comments or helper notes inside scripts to aid beginners

Requirements:
- For History Folder:
  - Suggest folder structure and naming conventions for storing previous builds, logs, validation outputs
- For CI/CD:
  - Provide a sample GitHub Actions YAML or step-by-step guide to automate Docker build → Minikube deploy → validation
- For Beginner Tips:
  - Annotate scripts (build-image.sh, optimize-image.sh, validation.sh, etc.) with comments explaining each command
  - Include safety notes for beginners (e.g., "Don't delete containers unless testing")

Output:
- Present all improvements in a concise, actionable format
- Provide any necessary example files, scripts, or configuration snippets
- Ensure beginner-friendly guidance and easy integration with the current Phase 4 folder structure
```
