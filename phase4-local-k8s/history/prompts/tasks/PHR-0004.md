# Prompt Text
```
Project Context:
- Root folder: hackathontwo
- Phase 4 folder: hackathontwo/phase4-local-k8s
- Application: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot (frontend + backend)
- Phase 1-3 complete; Phase 4 focuses on local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, Helm charts, kubectl-ai, Docker Desktop, and Gordon (Docker AI)
- All reusable agents and skills are defined in hackathontwo/.claude/

Input Plan:
- Use the Phase 4 `/sp.plan` output as reference, which contains step-by-step execution instructions, agents and skills mappings, folder/file creation, and validation steps

Goals:
- Convert the plan into **granular tasks** that can be executed one by one
- Each task should be actionable, beginner-friendly, and include:
   - Task number
   - Task description
   - Agent(s) to use
   - Skill(s) to use
   - Folder/file path if applicable
   - Validation/verification step
- Ensure task dependencies are respected (e.g., backend Docker image must be built before backend deployment)
- Tasks should be executable sequentially without skipping any prerequisites

Output Requirements:
- Present tasks in a **numbered list** for clarity
- Include clear **start and completion criteria** for each task
- Reference the `.claude` agents and skills wherever applicable
- Include optional **tips or hints** for beginners at each step
```

# Response Text
Created a comprehensive task list for Phase 4 with granular, actionable tasks organized by user stories, including dependencies, validation criteria, and agent/skill mappings. The tasks follow a clear checklist format with IDs and story labels for proper organization.

# Outcome Impact
Established a complete, executable task list for Phase 4 implementation with proper sequencing, dependencies, and validation checkpoints to ensure successful deployment of the Cloud Native Todo Chatbot to Minikube.

# Reflection Note
The tasks document provides a structured, executable roadmap with clear dependencies and validation steps, making it suitable for tracking progress during implementation while leveraging the available agents and skills.
