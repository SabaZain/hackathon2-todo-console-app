# Prompt Text
```
Project Context:
- Root folder: hackathontwo
- Phase 4 folder: hackathontwo/phase4-local-k8s
- Application: Cloud Native Todo Chatbot (frontend + backend)
- Phase 1-3 complete; Phase 4 focuses on local Kubernetes deployment using Minikube, Helm charts, kubectl-ai, Docker Desktop, and Gordon (Docker AI)
- All reusable agents and skills are defined in hackathontwo/.claude/

Input Specification:
- Use the Phase 4 `/sp.specify` output as reference, which defines Docker images, Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, validation steps, and constraints

Goals:
- Convert the specification into a **step-by-step actionable plan** for Phase 4
- Map each step to the **appropriate agent and skill** from .claude/
- Include **folder/file creation instructions** under phase4-local-k8s
- Include **validation/verification tasks** after each step
- Ensure beginner-friendly workflow and clear instructions

Output Requirements:
1. List steps in sequential order, each with:
   - Step number
   - Task description
   - Agent(s) to be used
   - Skill(s) to be used
   - Target folder/file path if applicable
   - Validation or verification instruction
2. Highlight dependencies between steps (e.g., backend image must be built before backend deployment)
3. Present the plan in a concise, easy-to-follow format for execution
```

# Response Text
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 4 with sequential steps, agent/skill mappings, validation tasks, and dependency tracking. The plan covers environment preparation, Dockerfile generation, image building, service deployment, optional Helm implementation, and final validation.

# Outcome Impact
Established a clear, executable roadmap for Phase 4 implementation with proper sequencing and validation checkpoints to ensure successful deployment.

# Tests Summary

# Next Prompts
none

# Reflection Note
The implementation plan provides a structured approach with clear dependencies and validation steps, making it suitable for execution by a beginner while leveraging the available agents and skills.
