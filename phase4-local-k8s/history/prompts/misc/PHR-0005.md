# Prompt Text
```
Review the implementation plan and tasks for Phase 4.
```

# Response Text
Reviewed all Phase 4 documents (spec, impl-plan, tasks, constitution) and assessed their alignment, completeness, and readiness for execution. Found strong alignment between documents, clear task organization, proper agent/skill integration, and comprehensive coverage of requirements.

# Outcome Impact
Validated that Phase 4 is well-planned with comprehensive documentation, aligned artifacts, and clear execution path for local Kubernetes deployment.

# Tests Summary
none

# Files Summary
phase4-local-k8s/spec.md, phase4-local-k8s/impl-plan.md, phase4-local-k8s/tasks.md, phase4-local-k8s/constitution.md

# Next Prompts
none

# Reflection Note
The review confirmed that Phase 4 is thoroughly planned with well-structured documents that align perfectly with the project's goals and constraints.
