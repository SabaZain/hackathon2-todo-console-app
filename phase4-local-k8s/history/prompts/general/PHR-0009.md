# Phase 4 Deployment Assistant Setup

## Summary
Created comprehensive deployment assistance tools for the Cloud Native Todo Chatbot Phase 4. Since the prerequisite tools (Docker, kubectl, Minikube, Helm) were not installed on the system, I created helper scripts and documentation to guide users through the complete deployment process.

## Files Created

1. `setup-prerequisites.ps1` - PowerShell script to help install required tools
2. `deploy-phase4.sh` - Bash script for Linux/Mac deployment workflow
3. `deploy-phase4.bat` - Windows batch script for deployment workflow
4. `PHASE4_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation
5. `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide for users

## Key Features

- Interactive step-by-step deployment process
- Prerequisite checking and validation
- Automated Docker image building and optimization
- Kubernetes deployment with proper ordering (backend first, then frontend)
- Validation checks at each step
- Optional scaling and Helm deployment options
- Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting guidance

## Process
The deployment assistant follows the original requirements:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Navigate to Phase 4 folder
3. Build and optimize Docker images
4. Start Minikube cluster
5. Deploy services in correct order
6. Validate deployment
7. Optional scaling and Helm deployment
8. Final summary and access information

## Outcome
Users can now run either `deploy-phase4.bat` (Windows) or `./deploy-phase4.sh` (Linux/Mac) to guide them through the complete Phase 4 deployment process with appropriate checks, validations, and user confirmations at each step.
