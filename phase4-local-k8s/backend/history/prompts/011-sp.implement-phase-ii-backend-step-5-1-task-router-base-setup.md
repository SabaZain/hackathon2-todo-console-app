# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.1 – Task Router Base Setup

## Intent
Create the backend routes skeleton for task-related APIs in Phase II of the Hackathon II Todo App with placeholder endpoints.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.1 – Task Router Base Setup"

Description:
I want you to create the backend routes skeleton for task-related APIs in Phase II of the Hackathon II Todo App.

Requirements:
1. File: fullstackwebapp/backend/routes/tasks.py
2. Implement a FastAPI router with the following endpoints as placeholders:
   - GET /api/tasks
   - POST /api/tasks
   - GET /api/tasks/{id}
   - PUT /api/tasks/{id}
   - DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
   - PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete
3. Each endpoint should include:
   - A placeholder function with proper parameters
   - Docstring explaining the purpose of the endpoint
   - Beginner-friendly comments for what to implement
   - HTTP status codes in comments (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404)
4. Import statements for FastAPI and SQLModel should be included
5. Use a router instance (APIRouter) and prefix `/api/tasks`
6. Do not implement actual database logic yet – only placeholders
7. Maintain clean, beginner-friendly structure and formatting
8. Save a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this command in:
   fullstackwebapp/backend/history/prompts/
9. Ensure this is fully self-contained for Step 5.1

Instructions for Claude CLI:
- Create the routes/tasks.py file with all placeholders as described
- Include clear comments and docstrings
- Do not write actual database queries yet
- Automatically create PHR as per backend constitution rules
- Confirm once the skeleton code and PHR are created

## Response Summary
Successfully created the task router skeleton with placeholder endpoints in routes/tasks.py. The implementation includes:
- Proper imports for FastAPI, SQLModel, and database dependencies
- A router instance (APIRouter) for task-related endpoints
- Six placeholder endpoints: GET, POST, GET by ID, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH for completion status
- Complete docstrings explaining the purpose of each endpoint
- Beginner-friendly comments indicating what to implement in each endpoint
- HTTP status codes documented in comments for each endpoint
- Proper parameter typing and response models where applicable

## Execution Note
The task router skeleton has been created with all required placeholder endpoints as specified in the requirements. Each endpoint includes proper documentation, parameters, and TODO comments for future implementation.
