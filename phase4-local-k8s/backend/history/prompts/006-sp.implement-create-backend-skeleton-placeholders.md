# Phase II Backend Skeleton Creation

## Summary
Created the Phase II Backend Skeleton with all required files and folders as placeholders for the Hackathon II Todo App, following the structure requirements and including appropriate comments as implementation guides.

## Prompt Text
```
create "Phase II Backend Skeleton with Placeholders"

Description:
I want you to set up the backend folder for Phase II of the Hackathon II Todo App inside the existing fullstackwebapp directory, including all necessary files, folders, and placeholders. This step is only for structure and placeholders; no functional code is required yet. All prompt history should be recorded automatically as per the backend constitution rules.

Requirements:

1. Folder Setup:
   - Ensure backend folder exists: fullstackwebapp/backend
   - Inside backend folder, create:
     - main.py
     - db.py
     - models.py
     - routes/ directory
     - history/ directory (for prompt history)
     - sp.constitution (already created)
     - sp.specify (already created)
     - sp.plan (already created)
     - sp.tasks (already created)
     - sp.implement (new placeholder for implementation steps)
     - CLAUDE.md (already created)

2. File Placeholders:
   - main.py:
     - Comment: "Placeholder for FastAPI app entry point"
     - Comment: "Include JWT middleware here"
     - Comment: "Include routes here"
   - db.py:
     - Comment: "Placeholder for database connection using SQLModel"
     - Comment: "Use DATABASE_URL environment variable"
   - models.py:
     - Comment: "Placeholder for SQLModel models"
     - Comment: "Define Task model and other necessary models"
   - routes/:
     - Create tasks.py
       - Comment: "Placeholder for all /api/tasks endpoints"
       - Comments for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH endpoints
   - history/:
     - Empty folder to store prompt history automatically

3. Coding Guidance:
   - Use comments to indicate where actual code will go later
   - Reference reusable agents and skills from .claude folder
   - Ensure beginner-friendly structure with clear, actionable placeholders

4. Prompt History Recording (PHR):
   - Automatically create PHR entry for this command
   - Save location: fullstackwebapp/backend/history/prompts/
   - Include:
     - Command used
     - Intent description
     - Full original prompt text
     - Note about automatic recording per backend constitution

Instructions for Claude:
- Only create folder structure and placeholder files
- Add comments as placeholders for implementation steps
- Do not write any functional code yet
- Confirm once the backend skeleton with placeholders and PHR setup is complete
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created the Phase II Backend Skeleton with all required files and folders as placeholders. The following were created:
- main.py with placeholder comments for FastAPI app entry point, JWT middleware, and routes
- db.py with placeholder comments for database connection using SQLModel and DATABASE_URL
- models.py with placeholder comments for SQLModel models and Task model definition
- routes/tasks.py with placeholder comments for all /api/tasks endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Verified that routes/ and history/ directories exist
- All existing files (sp.constitution, sp.specify, sp.plan, sp.tasks, sp.implement, CLAUDE.md) were already present

The skeleton is set up with appropriate comments as implementation guides, following the requirements for beginner-friendly structure with clear, actionable placeholders. No functional code was added, only placeholders as requested.
