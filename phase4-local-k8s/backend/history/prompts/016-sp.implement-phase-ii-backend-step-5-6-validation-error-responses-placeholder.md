# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.6 – Validation & Error Responses Placeholder

## Intent
Expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend to include placeholders for detailed validation and error response guidance on all task endpoints.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.6 – Validation & Error Responses Placeholder"

Description: Expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II backend to include placeholders for detailed validation and error response guidance on all task endpoints. No database queries should be implemented yet.

Requirements:
1. For all task endpoints (GET, POST, GET by ID, PUT, DELETE, PATCH):
   - Add comments and placeholder guidance for input validation:
     - Required fields, field types, length constraints
     - Checking for missing or invalid values
   - Add placeholders for consistent error handling:
     - 400 Bad Request
     - 401 Unauthorized
     - 403 Forbidden
     - 404 Not Found
   - Ensure guidance clearly indicates where to raise HTTPExceptions
   - Include beginner-friendly comments explaining each validation and error handling step
2. Maintain consistent formatting, docstring style, and placeholder style with previous steps
3. Create a Prompt History Record (PHR) documenting this step in backend/history/prompts/:
   - Include command used
   - Intent description
   - Full original prompt text
   - Note about automatic recording per backend constitution

Instructions for Claude:
- Only write placeholders and comments; do not implement actual database logic
- Keep code simple, clean, and beginner-friendly
- Clearly indicate where validation and error handling logic should occur

## Response Summary
Successfully enhanced all task endpoints in routes/tasks.py with comprehensive validation and error handling placeholders. The implementation includes:

- Enhanced GET endpoint with detailed validation and error handling guidance covering 400, 401, 403, 404, and 500 status codes
- Enhanced POST endpoint with comprehensive validation for title, description, user_id, and completed field validation, plus error handling patterns
- Enhanced GET by ID endpoint with detailed validation and error handling guidance
- Enhanced PUT endpoint with comprehensive validation for task_id, user_id, and task_data fields, plus error handling patterns
- Enhanced DELETE endpoint with detailed validation and error handling guidance
- Enhanced PATCH endpoint with comprehensive validation and error handling guidance
- Added consistent error handling guidance showing how to raise HTTPExceptions with appropriate status codes
- Added beginner-friendly comments indicating where actual validation logic should be implemented
- Maintained consistent formatting and placeholder style with previous steps

## Execution Note
All task endpoints have been enhanced with comprehensive validation and error handling placeholders as required, providing clear guidance for future implementation of actual validation and error handling logic.
