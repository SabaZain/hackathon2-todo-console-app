# Prompt History Record: Phase II Backend Step 5.3 – Input Validation & Error Handling Placeholders

## Intent
Expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II Hackathon II Todo App backend with placeholder code for input validation and error handling for all task endpoints.

## Original Prompt
create "Phase II Backend Step 5.3 – Input Validation & Error Handling Placeholders"

Description:
I want you to expand the routes/tasks.py file for Phase II Hackathon II Todo App backend. Add placeholder code for input validation and error handling for all task endpoints. No actual database logic should be implemented yet.

Requirements:
1. For each endpoint (GET /api/tasks, POST /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks/{id}, PUT /api/tasks/{id}, DELETE /api/tasks/{id}, PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/complete):
   - Include placeholder code for input validation:
     - Required fields
     - Field types (string, boolean, integer)
     - Field length constraints (title 1-200 chars, description max 1000 chars)
     - Optional vs required fields
   - Include placeholder code for error handling guidance:
     - 400 Bad Request for invalid input
     - 401 Unauthorized for missing JWT token
     - 403 Forbidden for ownership violations
     - 404 Not Found if task does not exist
   - All error handling should be described with comments and example code snippets (HTTPException) but without actual database checks
2. Use beginner-friendly comments explaining where to add actual validation logic and error responses
3. Ensure all docstrings and comments are clear for a beginner to implement later
4. Maintain consistent formatting and placeholder style from Steps 5.1 and 5.2
5. Create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this step, saved in backend/history/prompts/, documenting:
   - The command used
   - Intent description
   - Full original prompt text
   - Note that this follows the backend constitution Prompt History Recording Rule

Instructions for Claude:
- Only write placeholder code with detailed guidance in comments and docstrings
- No actual database queries should be added
- Keep the code simple, clean, and beginner-friendly
- Clearly indicate where each validation and error handling logic should go.

## Response Summary
Successfully enhanced the routes/tasks.py file with detailed input validation and error handling placeholders for all task endpoints. The implementation includes:
- Input validation for all parameters (task_id, user_id, task_data fields)
- Proper error handling with HTTPException examples for bad requests (400)
- Validation for field types, required fields, and length constraints
- Clear comments indicating where actual validation logic should be implemented
- Consistent formatting and beginner-friendly structure throughout

## Execution Note
The task router has been enhanced with comprehensive input validation and error handling placeholders as required, maintaining all existing functionality while adding detailed guidance for future implementation of validation logic.
