2. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid overly complex or ambiguous sentences.

3. **Reference Tasks by Number**: When updating tasks, refer to them by their number in the list.

4. **Ask for Clarifications**: If the bot misunderstands, ask it to repeat or clarify.

5. **Use Natural Language**: Talk naturally as you would with a friend.
