# Tasks: Phase 5 - Advanced Cloud Deployment & Event-Driven Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `phase-5/sp.specify` and `phase-5/sp.plan`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (completed), plan.md (completed)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All Phase 5 work is isolated in the `phase-5/` folder:
- Backend: `phase-5/backend/src/`
- Frontend: `phase-5/frontend/src/`
- Agents: `phase-5/agents/`
- Infrastructure: `phase-5/infrastructure/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Deployment (Phase 9)**: Can start after foundational infrastructure is ready
- **CI/CD (Phase 10)**: Depends on deployment infrastructure
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Works with all stories but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all stories but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Tracks all stories but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before routes/endpoints
- Backend before frontend
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Docker containerization tasks can run in parallel
- All Kubernetes manifest creation tasks can run in parallel
- All monitoring setup tasks can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Recurring Tasks)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Due Dates & Reminders)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 1 & 2 independently
6. Deploy to Minikube for local testing
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Recurring Tasks)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Reminders)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Priorities & Tags)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Search/Filter/Sort)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Real-Time Sync)
   - Developer F: User Story 6 (Audit Trail)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All work must remain in phase-5/ folder (Phase 1-4 files untouched)
- AuditAgent tracks 100% of task operations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Total Task Count

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 22 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Recurring Tasks)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Reminders)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Priorities & Tags)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Search/Filter/Sort)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Real-Time Sync)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Audit Trail)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Deployment)**: 25 tasks
- **Phase 10 (CI/CD & Monitoring)**: 21 tasks
- **Phase 11 (Polish)**: 22 tasks

**Total**: 150 tasks

**Next Steps**: Run `/sp.implement` to execute implementation tasks following this task breakdown.
